"""
Cell-style examples for the py-materials + build123d integration.

Each ``# %%`` block is an independent cell — open this file in VS Code
/ Jupyter / PyCharm to step through, or run top-to-bottom as a plain
Python script. The full script is also wired into the test suite via
``tests/test_build123d_integration_examples.py`` so every example is
kept in working condition.

Covers the shape of the API surface that build123d#1270's Materials
class will consume:

- ``pymat["name or key"]``   — exact lookup (#89)
- ``pymat.search(...)``       — fuzzy find (3.3.0)
- ``m.vis.source / .vis.*``   — visual props, inherited by grades (#88)
- ``m.vis.to_threejs()``      — Three.js handoff
- ``m.vis.to_gltf()``         — glTF 2.0 material node
- ``m.vis.mtlx.xml() / .export(dir)`` — MaterialX
- ``shape.material = m``      — build123d wiring
- ``export_gltf(shape, path)``— current baseColor-only path

# # 2. Look up a Material by name or key
#
# Three ways to resolve a user-typed string to a `Material`:
#
# | Form                              | When                                  |
# | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
# | `pymat["Stainless Steel 304"]`    | Exact match — raises if missing/amb.  |
# | `pymat.search(q, exact=True)`     | Same but returns `list[Material]`     |
# | `pymat.search(q)`                 | Fuzzy — tokenized, ranked list        |

# %%
# Exact by name (case + whitespace insensitive, NFKC-normalized)

assert housing_mat.grade == "304"

# %%
# Exact by registry key
bolt_mat = pymat["s316L"]
assert bolt_mat.grade == "316L"

# %%
# Exact by grade — grade strings like "304", "6061", "T6" all resolve
crystal_mat = pymat["304"]
assert crystal_mat.name == "Stainless Steel 304"

# %%
# Normalization — user-pasted strings with weird whitespace / case just work
assert pymat["  stainless   steel   304  "].name == "Stainless Steel 304"
assert pymat["STAINLESS STEEL 304"].name == "Stainless Steel 304"

# %%
# Unknown or ambiguous raises KeyError with a helpful candidate list

# # 3. Fuzzy search
#
# When the user query may match multiple materials (or none), use
# `pymat.search(...)` and decide how to present ambiguity.

# %%

print(f"{len(hits)} matches for 'Stainless Steel':")

# # 4. Vis properties inherited by grades (#88)
#
# Before 3.4 a grade without its own `[vis]` TOML section had `vis.source = None`.
# Now grades inherit the parent's vis — including textures, scalars, and
# the finishes map — while remaining independently mutable.

#
# Everything above ran top-to-bottom as a smoke test. The matching
# pytest runner calls `runpy` to exercise every cell on every CI run —
# if the API shape drifts, these examples go red before build123d
# picks them up.
