# [Issue 106]: [examples + Vis docstring teach the unsafe mutation pattern](https://github.com/MorePET/mat/issues/106)

DX review of 3.6.0 found the canonical example file teaches the registry-mutation hazard \`Vis.override\` was created to fix.

### Where

- \`examples/build123d_integration.py\` — does \`s304.vis.finish = \"brushed\"\` and even comments \"restore so downstream cells see consistent state\" — i.e. demonstrates the hazard *and the workaround*.
- \`src/pymat/vis/_model.py\` — \`Vis\` class docstring shows \`steel.vis.finish = \"polished\"\` as the canonical idiom. New users read this, copy the pattern, silently corrupt the registry singleton.

### Why this matters

Users learn idioms from the class docstring and the example file, not the CHANGELOG. As long as both teach mutation, \`override\` is invisible no matter how good the implementation is.

### Fix

- Update the \`Vis\` class docstring quickstart to show \`override\` as the canonical derive path.
- Update \`examples/build123d_integration.py\` to use \`m.vis = m.vis.override(finish=\"brushed\")\` (or, once #109 lands, \`m = m.with_vis(vis.override(...))\`). Keep one cell showing the in-place mutation only with an explicit "OK because we just constructed this Material" caveat.
- Add to \`pymat/vis/__init__.py\` module docstring: one sentence on registry-singleton semantics + override.

Closes the gap. Block on #109 (Material.copy / with_vis) before finalizing the example, since today \`m.vis = ...\` still mutates the Material singleton.

Fixed in [py-materials 3.6.0](https://github.com/MorePET/mat/releases/tag/v3.6.0) / [3.7.0](https://github.com/MorePET/mat/releases/tag/v3.7.0). `Vis.override` docstring (in `src/pymat/vis/_model.py`) explicitly teaches the safe-derive pattern (`steel.with_vis(steel.vis.override(...))`), warns against direct mutation of the registry singleton, and notes that `finishes` is deep-copied. Examples in `examples/` use the safe pattern throughout.
