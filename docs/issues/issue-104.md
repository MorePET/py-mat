# [Issue 104]: [Vis.override: caller-supplied finishes= dict not deep-copied](https://github.com/MorePET/mat/issues/104)

**Bug.** Found by independent implementation review of 3.6.0.

\`override\` deep-copies \`self.finishes\` (via \`deepcopy(self)\`) but stores any caller-supplied \`finishes=\` delta by reference. Diverges from the docstring promise and from \`merge_from_toml\`.

### Trigger
\`\`\`python
caller_dict = {\"matte\": {\"source\": \"x\", \"id\": \"y\"}}
v2 = v.override(finishes=caller_dict)
caller_dict[\"matte\"][\"id\"] = \"TAMPERED\"
assert v2.finishes[\"matte\"][\"id\"] == \"y\"  # FAILS — observes \"TAMPERED\"
\`\`\`

### Fix
Inside the loop that applies remaining deltas, deepcopy the value when \`k == \"finishes\"\`. Or route the whole \`finishes=\` path through \`Vis.from_toml({\"finishes\": ...})\` like \`merge_from_toml\` does (re-validates the slashed-string guard too).

Fixed in [py-materials 3.7.0](https://github.com/MorePET/mat/releases/tag/v3.7.0). `Vis.override` now `deepcopy`s the entire instance before applying deltas, including caller-supplied `finishes=` dicts — they can't alias the registry singleton's finish map. Pinned by the override tests in `tests/test_vis_override.py`.
