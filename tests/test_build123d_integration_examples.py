"""Execute ``examples/build123d_integration.py`` top-to-bottom as a test.

The examples file is a cell-style script (``# %%`` markers) mirroring
how build123d's author writes his own examples. Running the full script
in pytest keeps it honest: if any API drifts, the example — which is
what consumers are copy-pasting — goes red before they do.

We shell out via ``runpy.run_path`` rather than splitting cells because
cell-order matters (later cells use objects defined earlier). The
network-touching cells catch their own exceptions so a flaky mat-vis
CDN doesn't redline the whole example suite.
