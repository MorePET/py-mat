    Any object implementing `to_three_js_dict()` is a valid `PbrSource`.
    The native `pymat.properties.PBRProperties` and the optional
    `threejs_materials.PbrProperties` both conform.

    Consumers (ocp_vscode, build123d viewers, custom renderers) should
    call `to_three_js_dict()` to get a Three.js `MeshPhysicalMaterial`-
    shaped dict, agnostic of which backend is providing the data. This
    keeps the rendering pipeline decoupled from how the material was
    sourced (TOML authored / runtime downloaded / MaterialX baked).

    See ADR-0002 for the design rationale.
